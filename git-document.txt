Git Client
========
Git is a free and open-source version control system (VCS) that allows you to track changes in computer files and code. It's particularly popular with software development teams as it helps them collaborate effectively on projects.
Here are some key features of Git:
Tracks changes: Git keeps a history of all changes made to files, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
Version control: This enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
Branching: Git allows you to create branches of your codebase to experiment with new features or bug fixes without affecting the main project.
Merging: Once you're happy with the changes in a branch, you can easily merge them back into the main codebase.
Distributed: Unlike some other VCS systems, Git doesn't rely on a central server. Each developer has a complete copy of the project history, making collaboration easier.
